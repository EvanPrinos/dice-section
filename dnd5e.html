    <h1>D&D 5th Edition</h1>

    <p>
      Easily the largest TTRPG by community and by market presence,
      Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition has seen over a decade of 
      popularity. 5e's success as a system is primarily the result of
      releasing at the time of a cultural resurgence of interest for 
      TTRGPS, however, its own modularity and ease of modification.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      5e relies on a fairly light combat style, being tailored toward
      'theatre of the mind', a method of combat in which no battlemap
      is used. While 5e's books encourage this method of play, in 
      actual play many effects will depend on creatures' proximity to
      one another, and theatre of the mind ends up meaning that the
      GM is expected to shoulder the burden of keeping track of
      creatures' positions relative to one-another.
    </p>

    <h1>Homebrew</h1>

    <p>
      5e's most undeniable strength is its Homebrew. Homebrew is 
      player-made rules or content to modify a TTRPG experience to a
      table's wants. 5th Edition, due to its popularity and the 
      circumstances surrounding it, has several websites where users
      can create and even sell their homebrew to people who are 
      interested. Many of these sites even have their own reputations
      for better or worse.

    <h1>
      Bounded Accuracy
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      A concept that was overall given a name by discourse around D&D 
      5e, bounded accuracy is the idea that normal rolls don't vary 
      between high and low level characters. It's easier to define 
      Bounded Accuracy by what it isn't, so for context, in D&D 4e, 
      players add half their level to their defenses, attack rolls, 
      and skill checks. The effect of removing this system for D&D 5e 
      was intended to be that enemies weren't locked to characters of
      specific levels, although generally similar problems could be 
      solved with use of homebrew. Still, it's one of 5e's most 
      thought-out systems, easily.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Balance or Lack Thereof
    </h1>

    <p>
      5th edition's balance has seen heavy criticism over its 
      lifespan, from points about its resource-based classes and its
      resource-less classes being given the same power baselines, to
      the reality-bending abilities of magic within its system, while
      the game seems begrudging to give its martials even basic 
      superhuman feats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Funnily, one of the largest categories of 5e homebrew is 
      rebalancing the system, either as changes to base 5th edition,
      or baked into customized rulesets made to tailor its rulesets
      to other settings (For two such examples, I'd recommend Star 
      Wars 5e and Arknights 5e, which put a lot of effort into trying
      to solve some such inconsistencies).
    </p>

    <p>
      Many homebrewers even have a regular phrase between them of 
      'anything after level 13 doesn't have to be balanced', which
      stems from the fact that well before that level, most 5e games 
      get so unbalanced that GMs tend to ensure their games end 
      before such levels, so features at that point don't have to be 
      designed with use in mind, so much as to fulfill a class's 
      fantasy.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Setting
    </h1>

    <p>
      5th Edition's setting is the Forgotten Realms, a Tolkien-esque
      generic fantasy world with a rich cosmology. Since I prefer 
      crafting my own worlds, I don't follow the Forgotten Realms 
      much. What does interest me, though, is how this setting 
      interprets many real-world mythologies into it. One of my 
      favourite examples is the Gorgon, which keeps the petrifying 
      abilities of its namesake, but rather than looking like a 
      Gorgon, looks like this:
    </p>
    
    <center><img src="images/Gorgon.png"></center>

    <p>
      Due to how iconic the Greek gorgon design is, though, the 
      traditional look still exists within the Forgotten Realms as a
      Medusa. To me, this anacronism between the setting's want to be
      different, but still giving in to the popular image implies an 
      interesting history of trying to have one's cake and eat it 
      too.
  </p>

  <h1>
    Class Philosophy
  </h1>

  <p>
    5th edition's class philosophy is largely nonexistent in terms
    of thought put into the division of roles and power. The only 
    thing distinguishing the barbarian class as a tank is that it 
    is durable, with zero ways to draw aggro or exceptional ways to
    punish enemies for ignoring them. Similarly, subclasses cannot 
    consistently distinguish between providing a secondary role or 
    a gameplay gimmick.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spellcasters 'suffer' especially from this, where their ability 
    to choose spells from their class's entire list, with 
    subclasses only sometimes adding extra spells means that most 
    spellcasters already have access to spells that allow them to 
    cover multiple needs, as well as enough spell slots later on 
    that their 'role' as a resource-based class isn't too valid, 
    either.
  </p>
