    <h1>Pathfinder</h1>

    <p>
      Produced as a system after D&D's publishers failed to maintain 
      their magazine contract, Pathfinder the TTRPG was Paizo 
      Publishing's way to stay in business, and these days, 
      Pathfinder second edition, or PF2e, is one of D&D's largest 
      competitors in the fantasy genre. Paizo as a company has 
      generally been one of Pathfinder's greatest assets, as they are
      known for consistently making user-friendly business decisions.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      Among these decisions include heavy player support tools, 
      similar to the ones that D&D has licensed for 5th edition. 
      Pathfinder has Archives of Nethys, an entire maintained wiki 
      which allows a player to access all of PF2e's systems, rules,
      and definitions for free, as well as Pathbuilder2e, a character 
      creation site which lists all available options, and is a one-
      time purchase, rather than D&D's subscription-based equivalent.

    <h1>
      Homebrew
    </h1>

    <p>
      Pathfinder similarly has a large amount of homebrew available 
      to its players due to its large community, but due to the 
      greater complexity of building a character, many new players 
      may be too dependent on Pathbuilder2e, which doesn't include 
      such content, making homebrew generally less accessible than
      it is to 5th edition, where D&D's publisher has ensured that its 
      homebrew sites can interface with or are even on the same 
      website as its most popular sponsored character builder.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result of this difference in out-of-game infrastructure 
      and my own limited time playing Pathfinder Second Edition, I 
      cannot accurately make statements about the quality of PF2e's
      homebrew scene.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Feats and Progression
    </h1>

    <p>
      One design field where I think Pathfinder excells is its 
      character progression. Alongside the standard addition of one's
      level to rolls which is common in many TTRPGs, Pathfinder makes 
      the distinction that even that bonus is still only given to a 
      character with training in whatever they're doing, which 
      heavily encourages cooperation among players to achieve their 
      goals, as a single character very explicitly cannot be so much 
      as passable in every skill check they may need across an 
      adventure. Additionally, with each skill having multiple levels
      of training it can receive to increase the bonus given, players
      are allowed to pick up additional skills at later levels or 
      further train their specialties, unlike D&D, which largely 
      suffers from characters having the same skills from start to
      end of a story, and only really growing in terms of combat 
      ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, PF2e's Feats system is a return to the form of how 
      Feats (or Features) worked in D&D editions before 5e, being an
      additional trick a character can pick up each level or two, 
      from large list. To discourage optimization, though, PF2e 
      disects feats based on origin, and each point where a character
      gets to choose a feat, they're told which kind they get to 
      choose, meaning that players don't feel as though they need to
      prioritize all combat-related feats to stay relevant.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Balance
    </h1>

    <p>
      PF2e's balance due to the aforementioned carefully-engineered 
      progression model is very structurally sound, with characters 
      maintaining similar scopes of ability. Additionally, PF2e curbs 
      the martial-caster divide partly by limiting caster resources. 
      In PF2e, a caster eventually reaches a point where their Spell 
      Slots (the ammunition used to cast spells in most fantasy 
      TTRPGs) stop increasing in number, and instead only grow in 
      power going forward, taking old low-level Spell Slots and 
      turning them into higher-level ones. This serves to keep caster
      resources much more managable, compared to D&D5e, where a high-
      level caster can feel inexaustible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside roping in the higher end of the divide that often 
      faces fantasy TTRPGs, Pathfinder also broadly works to ensure 
      that its martial characters feel as though they have more 
      distinct high points to work with, such as unique class 
      resources to spend, recover in special ways, or above-average
      power baselines.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Setting
    </h1>

    <center><img src="images/Golarion.png"></center>

    <p>
      Due to its history of existing due to failed maintenance of a
      contract, Pathfinder as a franchise of course felt the need to
      make its own setting for its games to take place in by default.
      This setting is Golarion, and broadly, it holds many 
      similarities to the Forgotten Realms, such as the same sorts of 
      gorgons that I showcase in the 5th edition page. Whether this
      was a piece of lore that Paizo wanted to keep, feeling it was 
      iconic, or because they overlooked changing it at all, 
      similarities like this raise intriguing questions, attesting to
      the law of design "It exists the way it does because somebody 
      made it so". 
    </p>

    <h1>
      Class Philosophy
    </h1>

    <p>
      As stated so far, PF2e put a lot of thought into the ecosystem
      that exists around its classes and characters. Two good 
      examples of similar distinctions it makes to cement class roles
      are firstly, the limitation of spells through preparation,
      wherein a character must decide which spells they expect to be 
      using at the start of an adventuring day, and cannot reallocate 
      those spells and spell slots retroactively. The second example 
      is much more sublte, but it's the restriction of the Attack of 
      Opportunity. An Attack of Opportunity in a TTRPG is an attack 
      out of turn in response to an action an enemy took, allowing a 
      character to threaten an enemy to act a certain way, such as 
      discouraging attacking their allies or moving away. In most 
      TTRPGs, Attacks of Opportunity are available to all characters,
      while in PF2e, they are a class feature or a Feat that must be
      invested in deliberately later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both of these changes serve distinct purposes in encouraging 
      specific teamwork and roles within a party. Being forced to 
      choose one's spells in advance encourages players to divvy up
      their prepared spells based on coverage, so that the party as a 
      whole doesn't suffer from blind spots, since one character is 
      unable to cover all weaknesses by themselves as a default. 
      Additionally, casters are still given a large list of known 
      spells, encouraging preparing to cover multiple roles, and then
      deciding with teammates which ones to cover. Similarly, the 
      limitation of Attack of Opportunity to certain characters 
      creates 'anchors' which can reshape the flow of combat around
      themselves and provide the party a new axis to master.
    </p>
