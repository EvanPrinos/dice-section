    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Dice-Section is a blog-esque page for me to write about my 
      interests in Table-Top Role-Playing Games and the differences 
      between them at their cores. I myself have a YouTube channel,
      but I mainly play games and occasionally discuss their designs
      briefly. The reason for this is my own interest in game design,
      which will be informing many parts of my analyses going 
      forward.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      I've played Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition for over a decade,
      and it has painted some of my understanding of the fundamental
      flow of TTRPGs. Meanwhile, I have played Pathfinder 2nd 
      Edition, Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition, and Lancer for only
      two to three years, each, and most of my experience as a Game 
      Master comes from Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Part of the reason for this is partly my own interest in High-
      Fantasy and exploring how science and civilization evolve in a
      world with unrecognizable fundamental laws like chemistry or
      physics.
