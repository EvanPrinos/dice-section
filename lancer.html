    <h1>Lancer</h1>

    <p>
      One of the only Science-Fiction TTRPGs I've played, Lancer was 
      developed and published independently by Massif Press after a 
      wildly successful kickstarter campaign.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      The system was designed by writer and visual artist duo Miguel
      Lopez-Hall and Tom Bloom, and draws a lot from optimistic and 
      early Sci-Fi, such as Star Trek for the world it takes place 
      in.

    <h1>
      Support and Homebrew
    </h1>

    <p>
      For being the first project of an independent publisher, Lancer
      has an interesting development to its player support tools, 
      specifically COMP/CON, a fully player-made site for accessing
      rules, content, and information on the game. Additionally, this
      site allows players to integrate any homebrew conditions or 
      rules into the version stored on their cookies through text 
      files called LCPs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Newer official Lancer content comes with a publicly-accessible
      free LCP file designed by Massif Press to instantly upload the
      new materials into your copy of COMP/CON, making for a very
      constructive and alive community-developer symbiotic 
      relationship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, tools exist online to create one's own LCP files,
      and while they can be finnicky, this free access for any player
      offsets a large amount of the issues that a character-making 
      encyclopedic site normally provides for new players wanting to
      design or use homebrew, showcasing an interesting strength of 
      Lancer's surrounding infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Mechs and Modularity
    </h1>

    <p>
      An important detail of Lancer's character creation is the way 
      that players are encouraged to tailor their abilities to a form
      of combat that they find appealing, much like an engineer 
      designing a machine. The fact that there are multiple avenues 
      to build a character through as well means that as a player's 
      character progresses, they can feel as though they're advancing
      in multiple fields at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among these fields of progression are core stats which increase
      numbers and parameters, talents, which grant bonuses to 
      specific types of gear, and licenses, which provide access to
      frames and equipment. This structure of growth, as well as the
      fact that any one channel within these fields can only be 
      pursued for at most three levels pressures players to plan 
      ahead and decide on multiple gimmicks, rather than having a 
      single most-effective build.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Balance
    </h1>

    <p>
      In Lancer, with the wide variety of choices and the matter of 
      building balancing party roles and options is handled primarily
      through a rock > paper > scissors dynamic, where disruption can 
      punish tank-like mechs, but struggles when outright attacked, 
      possibly even from distances where it can't retaliate, and may
      rely on the same durable, aggressive mechs it can abuse to deal 
      with such enemies. There are many more specializations that 
      aren't listed, but other examples of such a balancing act are 
      the six distinct defenses that can be targeted, which no build
      can be good at more than four of at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, with both a health and heat bar to keep safe, as 
      well as a wide variety of status conditions that can disrupt 
      certain playstyles, but may feel inconsequential to others, no 
      build in Lancer is ever able to feel as though it has no 
      Achilles Heel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lancer's balancing of specific equipment options within roles 
      is also varied, being anything from cost to equip, heat 
      generation from activation, use limits, to specialized 
      weaknesses in some specific cases. It also employs a focus on
      opportunity cost, where the sluggish rate of progression is 
      used to make players carefully weigh the potential order that
      they should prioritize making choices.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Setting
    </h1>

    <center><img src="images/Raleigh.webp"></center>

    <p>
      As hinted at earlier, Lancer's setting is optimistic Sci-Fi, 
      which specifically tries to avoid a lot of the major themes of
      dystopian settings. Interestingly, this setting does not avoid
      dystopias themselves, as there is still darkness in the society
      that has risen since the fall of Cradle (Earth), only these 
      dark truths are treated as human injustices to be stopped and 
      circumvented, rather than inevitable costs of the technology 
      level. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the setting, this is referred to as a post-scarcity world, 
      with food and shelter being easy enough to print that no one
      can be denied it. A basic summary of Lancer's lore is that 
      humanity explored space, factionalized due to distance from 
      each other, engaged in a civil war, fell into fascism, and then
      liberated themselves with another civil war, placing us at the
      present of the universe's story, where government mech pilots
      called Lancers enforce utopia across the galaxy, fighting back
      human rights violations wherever they find them. It's not a 
      novel theme in the grand scheme of Sci-Fi, but in a modern 
      landscape, the world has a great appeal.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might notice that I'm talking about this setting a lot more
      than the other ones; The reason for that is that Lancer is one 
      of the rare TTRPGs that doesn't try to be setting-agnostic and 
      instead locks many of its mechanics to the world it takes place 
      in, such as the mech options being intrinsically tied to the 
      big four villainous manufacturers, who are in turn each tied to
      the themes of Lancer, representing different extremes. This 
      adherence to a setting is a notable design decision, as not all
      TTRPGs try to be setting-agnostic, and to get the most out of
      such TTRPG systems, players are more encouraged to learn the 
      world. This is a highly-notable part of game design, where 
      certain actions will consistently encourage a behaviour that a
      designer might want.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Build Philosophy
    </h1>

    <p>
      Lancer's player builds have already been discussed a fair bit, 
      but the underlying philosophies behind these systems are one of
      the system's greatest assets. This encouragement to select a 
      few of the hundreds of paths available to you and trust your 
      team to cover your back are executed incredibly seamlessly in 
      Lancer compared to most TTRPGs. A core example is control, a 
      role generally focused around corraling or dealing with groups
      of enemies in other systems. In Lancer, combats are designed 
      with objectives in mind, playing more like a match-made 
      strategy game, than a simple, all-out slugfest. This means that
      the ability to deny enemies certain routes or positions, or 
      even simply teleport the enemy off of an objective, feels far 
      more rewarding than in another system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other non-damage roles similarly get to feel far more useful in
      Lancer, such as defenders, tanks whose value feels 
      significantly improved by their ability to threaten large 
      swaths of area with their CQC weapons, and who are a core way
      for teams to prevent damage, as Lancer has only one healing 
      mech available to users.
    </p>
