    <h1>Lancer</h1>

    <p>
      One of the only Science-Fiction TTRPGs I've played, Lancer was 
      developed and published independently by Massif Press after a 
      wildly successful kickstarter campaign.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      The system was designed by writer and visual artist duo Miguel
      Lopez-Hall and Tom Bloom, and draws a lot from optimistic and 
      early Sci-Fi, such as Star Trek for the world it takes place 
      in.

    <h1>
      Support and Homebrew
    </h1>

    <p>
      For being the first project of an independent publisher, Lancer
      has an interesting development to its player support tools, 
      specifically COMP/CON, a fully player-made site for accessing
      rules, content, and information on the game. Additionally, this
      site allows players to integrate any homebrew conditions or 
      rules into the version stored on their cookies through text 
      files called LCPs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Newer official Lancer content comes with a publicly-accessible
      free LCP file designed by Massif Press to instantly upload the
      new materials into your copy of COMP/CON, making for a very
      constructive and alive community-developer symbiotic 
      relationship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, tools exist online to create one's own LCP files,
      and while they can be finnicky, this free access for any player
      offsets a large amount of the issues that a character-making 
      encyclopedic site normally provides for new players wanting to
      design or use homebrew, showcasing an interesting strength of 
      Lancer's surrounding infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Mechs and Modularity
    </h1>

    <p>
      An important detail of Lancer's character creation is the way 
      that players are encouraged to tailor their abilities to a form
      of combat that they find appealing, much like an engineer 
      designing a machine. The fact that there are multiple avenues 
      to build a character through as well means that as a player's 
      character progresses, they can feel as though they're advancing
      in multiple fields at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among these fields of progression are core stats which increase
      numbers and parameters, talents, which grant bonuses to 
      specific types of gear, and licenses, which provide access to
      frames and equipment. This structure of growth, as well as the
      fact that any one channel within these fields can only be 
      pursued for at most three levels pressures players to plan 
      ahead and decide on multiple gimmicks, rather than having a 
      single most-effective build.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Balance
    </h1>

    <p>
      In Lancer, with the wide variety of choices and the matter of 
      building balancing party roles and options is handled primarily
      through a rock > paper > scissors dynamic, where disruption can 
      punish tank-like mechs, but struggles when outright attacked, 
      possibly even from distances where it can't retaliate, and may
      rely on the same durable, aggressive mechs it can abuse to deal 
      with such enemies. There are many more specializations that 
      aren't listed, but other examples of such a balancing act are 
      the six distinct defenses that can be targeted, which no build
      can be good at more than four of at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, with both a health and heat bar to keep safe, as 
      well as a wide variety of status conditions that can disrupt 
      certain playstyles, but may feel inconsequential to others, no 
      build in Lancer is ever able to feel as though it has no 
      Achilles Heel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lancer's balancing of specific equipment options within roles 
      is also varied, being anything from cost to equip, heat 
      generation from activation, use limits, to specialized 
      weaknesses in some specific cases. It also employs a focus on
      opportunity cost, where the sluggish rate of progression is 
      used to make players carefully weigh the potential order that
      they should prioritize making choices.
