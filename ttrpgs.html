    <h1>TTRPGs</h1>

    <p>A TTRPG, or a Table-Top Role-Playing Game, is by definition a 
      game where players play as characters using a physical medium,
      traditionally pencils, paper, dice, and possibly figures on a
      board. By default, most TTRPGs are also characterized by a 
      focus on combat and exploration, as well as teamwork, however
      theoretically these are not mandatory to the definition.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      Additionally, most TTRPGs include a Game Master, or GM, a
      player whose role is to control the environment and all other
      characters. This role is traditionally best compared to a game
      engine, rather than an adversary to the players, as TTRPGs are
      'won' by having all players enjoy the session and look forward
      to playing again and continuing the story or a new one together
      in the future. Some systems exist that are GM-less, such 
      as using dice rolls and tables to determine how a world would
      react to the activities of the players' characters, but I have
      not played such systems yet, so this difference in game design
      ideology will not be addressed in my current iteration of a 
      Dice-Section.
    </p>

    <h1>Characters</h1>

    <p>Most modern TTRPGs have a focus on allowing players to make
      characters that are personalized to a fantasy or archetype that
      the player may want to embody within the world of the game. 
      This often includes stats and abilities, although many systems
      facilitate this in different ways. A common way in fantasy 
      TTRPGs is classes, which draw from popular fantasy archetypes
      set out by series such as Lord of the Rings, however classes
      are not the only axis of character customization, and sometimes
      aren't one of the axes available at all. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As an enjoyer of High-Fantasy worlds, many of the systems I've 
      played are Fantasy-inspired, however, there will be discussion
      of games designed to be set in other settings as well, and will
      highlight some other ways that characters can be customized in
      further detail in general.
    </p>

    <h1>Dice</h1>

    <p>
      As mentioned, dice became a traditional staple of TTRPGs early 
      on with the earliest examples, and are broadly used to roll and
      determine the efficacy of an action taken by one's character.
      While I lack the omniscience to determine how this decision was
      made at the time, the core benefit of dice in TTRPGs is to help 
      distinguish between a player and a character. An anecdotal 
      example of this was when my brother was still new to TTRPGs, he
      would describe his Dungeons and Dragons character delivering 
      fatal blows, and would be upset that the damage dealt didn't
      reflect the lethality of the attack. The explanation I gave for
      this disconnect was that the character might not immediately be
      in an advantageous position to slit an enemy's throat, and the
      dice help reflect the circumstances surrounding the characters
      in the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, the dice encourage a level of improvisation to the
      game which can enliven it. The surface-level example of this is
      that plans can fail unexpectedly, but more specifically, a 
      failed roll pushes the players to decide why in the story that
      action failed, such as a moment of distraction, an unfortunate
      slapstick routine, or whichever other reason pops into the 
      players' heads in the moment. In general, the dice's influence
      on the game acts as an additional player ensuring that the
      resulting story is personalized, too, even if the same players
      play together again.
