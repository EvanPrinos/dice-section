    <h1>D&D 4th Edition</h1>

    <p>
      Unquestionably D&D's most controversial edition, D&D4e's 
      reception was soured by changes to the Open Game License around
      the time of its release, allowing Wizards of the Coast, its 
      publisher, to collect more money from content created off of
      their first new TTRPG. Ironically, this effort left the system 
      far less profitable than it could have been, and socially 
      derelicted.
    </p>
        
    <p>
      D&D 4e has a great rising community, as more people actually 
      play it and challenge the public perception, which often fails 
      to even be grounded in fact.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Homebrew
    </h1>

    <p>
      D&D4e's homebrew community never got to really spread its wings
      due to the TableTop Gaming community's rejection of the system, 
      and much of the homebrew which is emerging is from new 4th 
      Edition renaissances. This lack of homebrew definitely hurts
      D&D4e, though, as the system could do well with a character-
      building tool; The system relies heavily on combing through 
      splatbooks to find features and powers for the class you're 
      playing to put together your build, and a single site which 
      highlights all of those options in a single managable format 
      would greatly benefit new and old players.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, a lot of 5th edition's modularity originally came 
      from D&D4e, and was then scuttled to make the next edition by
      casting aside the name that failed. This similarity to D&D5e is
      also the reason for much of D&D4e's renaissance, as it's 
      considered a more balanced and polished version of D&D5e by 
      some users. 
    </p>

    <h1>
      D&D Tactics?
    </h1>

    <p>
      A common phrase in D&D4e's discussion is that if it had been 
      branded as 'D&D Tactics', it would have seen far better 
      reception. These arguments neglect the system's PR turning on
      it suddenly before release due to the Open Game License 
      announcements or the fact that it ultimately has the same out-
      of-combat systems as D&D5e, which is known as a roleplay-heavy
      system despite absolutely not being one.
    </p>

    <center><img src="images/battlemap.avif"></center>

    <p>
      The fundamental wisdom behind this description as 'D&D Tactics'
      is still real in a way, as a major part of D&D4e's design 
      philosophy was in enriching its combat to feel dynamic outside 
      of hitting the opponent and repeating. A large amount of this
      combat thought and design was later adopted by Lancer and later
      editions of Pathfinder, such as its second edition. Ultimately,
      4e was the source of a large number of successful ideas which
      existed to make player choices matter more, and it's a shame
      that players who barely experienced the system give the 
      takeaway that it was 'D&D Tactics', or that WOTC's own takeaway
      when designing D&D5e was that their mistake was 'making the 
      game elements obvious'.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Balance
    </h1>

    <p>
      D&D4e's balancing is an interesting matter, because the system
      is widely-considered one of the best-balanced options, with no
      such thing as a famously-weak class, and the most powerful 
      still only being called 'solid'. Additionally, D&D4e bridged 
      the famous martial-caster divide. There is some controversy 
      over how this was done, as the method was to effectively give
      martial characters their own 'spells' called exploits, and to 
      limit casters' reality-bending to rituals, which cost gold per
      use (in-game, not out of game, with the slander 4e has 
      received, I can absolutely see someone willfully 
      misinterpreting that).
    </p>

    <p>
      Broadly, this universalization of how each class's abilities 
      and power budget was formatted makes for a system that 
      encourages any class to be balanced and viable, although some
      reasonable counter-arguments are that it was too heavy-handed, 
      and stripped the identities of some classes in the process. In 
      the present, Lancer exists as an important counter-example, 
      which, for all of the inspiration it took from D&D4e, produced
      a system where character options feel as though they have much
      more individual personality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, 4e is one of my fundamentally-favourite fantasy RPG 
      systems, as its commitment to balance, especially through all 
      of its shakeups and hurdles is inspiring, and its design, when
      allowed to be unconstrained, such as psionic powers, druidic
      wild-shape, or monastic disciplines, all show great potential 
      that was suffocated too early.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Setting
    </h1>

    <p>
      I can't speak much to D&D4e's setting, as it's very similar to
      the forgotten realms. The Points of Light, 4e's setting, is a
      broadly-generic fantasy setting designed to be a 'blank slate' 
      for GMs. I'm not the largest fan of this, but it's interesting
      at least that it carries many of the design decisions of the 
      forgotten realms. For example, what is this image?
    </p>

    <center><img src="images/Medusa.webp"></center>
    <!--<a href="assignment1.html"><img src="images/assignment-hero.png"> </img>Assignment 1</a>-->

    <p>
      This is not a Gorgon, this is a Medusa. A Gorgon in Points of
      Light is the same bull creature that also can petrify like a
      Medusa can from the Forgotten Realms. Much of D&D's setting is
      invented in its old editions, where things were slapped
      together based on what the writers liked. The reason I feel 
      that newer editions such as D&D4e, D&D5e, and Pathfinder2e 
      simply make their rulesets setting-agnostic and don't change
      these settings is that the players who care would throw a fit
      similar in scale to the one which killed D&D4e, and the players
      who don't care weren't playing in these old settings, anyways.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Class Philosophy
    </h1>

    <p>
      D&D4e's balance comes largely from its class design. All
      classes fall into one of four roles, those being Defender, 
      Controller, Striker, or Leader. Defenders are slightly more 
      durable, but notably have improved Attacks of Opportunity which 
      can circumvent the usual methods to evade them, and can Mark 
      enemies, forcing those enemies to focus fire on the Defender or
      suffer a penalty. Controllers are the only role with full and 
      ready access to flexible multi-target attacks and status 
      effects consistently available in their powers, and act as wild
      cards in their ability to disrupt enemy plans. Strikers have 
      innate DPR steroids, allowing them to output more single-target
      damage than other classes can by default. Lastly, Leaders all 
      have access to healing abilities inherently.
    </p>

    <p>
      These roles are balanced between each-other by covering 
      different sections of combat, and then balanced within their 
      own rosters as a way for D&D4e to ensure its class balance.
      Despite this stringent, system, class individuality still 
      exists, such as Paladins, which are Defenders with access to 
      healing like a miniature Leader. Avengers are Strikers with a
      focus on hunting a single target who becomes unable to hide, 
      and an inability to change targets until a fight is over or the
      victim is dead. Rogues are Strikers whose damage steroid is 
      significantly more potent than their contemporaries, but rely
      on allies helping grant them combat advantage before they can 
      benefit from this steroid. Bards are Leaders who have the 
      ability to Mark enemies on allies' behalf, allowing them to 
      turn an ally into a psuedo-Defender, or even allow a Defender 
      to juggle multiple Marks at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feats, similarly, allow characters to specialize into 
      additional tasks outside of their role's identity, or to double 
      down on their intended roles and strengths, to be significantly
      more efficient, but limited in scope.
